# Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

This repository corresponds to a module of my master in BigData and Business Analytics at UCM.

In this module we learnt how to apply Agile methodology to a [ML compentition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table) working in teams and trying to beat our mates getting the highest score.

The files structure is kind of self-explanatory but I will show some details:
```
root
|___dat -> All the datasets created
|___img -> All the images and figures used in the document
|___mod -> All the models created to compete
|___sub -> All the submissions made during the course
|___html -> Some .css and .html files to improve my documentation
|___*.R -> All the code used to bulid the documentation
|___documento.Rmd -> Rmarkdown file with the documentation
|___documento.html -> Knited .Rmd file
```

You must use the function `readRDS` to read most of the models and data files, I did it on purpose because if you do it this way the files would keep the data types.

I think that's all, enjoy it!
